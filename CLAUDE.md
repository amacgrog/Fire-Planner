# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (or any AI assistant) working in this repo.

## What this is

Offline, single-file HTML FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) calculators
for a couple or single person — one for the US, one for Canada. Everything
(markup, CSS, and JS) lives in one `<script>` block per file; there is no
build step, no bundler, no framework, and no server. Opening the `.html` file
in a browser is the entire deployment. See `README.md` for the full feature
list from a user's perspective — this file is about how to work in the code.

## Files

- `Planner_US.html` / `Planner_Canada.html` — the two apps. Each is fully
  self-contained (~4,500–4,700 lines including the inline `<script>`).
  **Stable filenames**: never rename these or create version-numbered copies
  (`Planner_US_v2.html`, etc.) — every update is a `git commit` to the same
  file, not a rename-and-fix-links exercise. See "Versioning" in README.md.
- `index.html` — a small landing page linking to both tools.
- `tests/golden.js` — hand-verified year-by-year drawdown/compounding math
  checks, run via `npm test`. This is the only test wired into CI
  (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
- `test_*.js` (repo root) — a suite of Playwright scripts covering UI/feature
  behavior (scenarios, Monte Carlo, life expectancy, FHSA, income sources,
  hover tooltips, expenses, the historical backtest, etc). These are **not**
  run by `npm test` or CI — run them individually with `node test_foo.js`.
  They open the actual `.html` file with a headless Chromium
  (`playwright.chromium.launch()` + `file://` URL) and assert against live
  DOM/state, not against a mocked harness. When you add a feature, add or
  extend one of these rather than only relying on `tests/golden.js`, and
  actually run it — don't just eyeball the diff.

## Architecture, per planner file

Each planner is one big IIFE. The core shape:

- `defaults` — the full default state object (every input field's default
  value, including nested arrays like `loans`, `spendingTiers`,
  `incomeSources`, `oneTimeIncome`).
- `normalizeState(raw)` — merges a raw/partial state (autosave, imported
  scenario file, hand-edited) over `defaults`. This is what keeps old
  exported scenarios loading correctly after the tool changes shape: missing
  fields fall back to defaults, unknown fields are dropped. Any new enum-like
  field needs a guard here (see the `filingStatus`/`tenure`/`province`
  pattern) or a bad value can silently corrupt the simulation.
- `ids` — an array of plain-numeric input element IDs that get auto-wired:
  each gets an `input` listener that writes `state[id] = Number(...)`, and
  the MCP tool schema (`update_fire_assumptions`) spreads this array in as
  `{ type: 'number' }` properties "for free". Booleans, enums, and anything
  with side effects (like `singlePerson`) are wired by hand instead — see
  their own listeners further down.
- `simulate(retireAgeA, retireAgeB)` — the main year-by-year drawdown/
  compounding engine. Returns `{ rows, depletedAge, ... }` where `rows` is
  one object per projection year. This is what almost every chart/table/
  metric in the app is built from — it gets called multiple times per
  render (once for the current settings, again for each ±1yr/±3yr line,
  again per Monte Carlo path, again per sensitivity-analysis sweep, etc.),
  so it needs to stay reasonably cheap.
- `simulateHistorical(rowFn, retireAgeA, retireAgeB)` — a **near-duplicate**
  of `simulate()`, used by the historical-backtest and Monte Carlo views.
  Instead of one fixed nominal return, it takes a `rowFn(year)` that returns
  actual-historical `[calendarYear, stockReturn, inflation, bondReturn]` for
  that year, replayed from an embedded 1928–2025 dataset (or a randomly
  block-bootstrapped path, for Monte Carlo).
- `syncControls()` and `syncContributionControls()` — **two separate**
  functions that both push `state` back into the DOM (checkbox states,
  hidden/shown field groups, button `.active` classes, `<output>` text).
  Which one handles a given control is not obvious from the name — check
  where sibling/related controls already live before adding a new one. A
  common bug pattern in this codebase: writing a new field's DOM-sync line
  into the *wrong* one of these two functions, so the field's underlying
  `state` value updates correctly but its visibility/checked-state never
  refreshes. If a checkbox's own `.checked` reads correctly but a dependent
  field group's `.hidden` doesn't update, this is the first thing to check.
- `render()` — the main "redraw everything" function, called after every
  input change. Cheap-to-expensive: collapsible cards (tornado chart, Roth/
  RRSP bracket optimizer, cash-flow Sankey diagram) are only computed when
  `card.open` is true, gated inline in `render()`, with a matching `toggle`
  event listener that calls `render()` when the user expands the card. When
  adding a new expensive collapsible result, follow this pattern rather than
  computing it unconditionally on every keystroke.
- MCP tool hooks (`read_fire_projection`, `update_fire_assumptions`) near
  the bottom of the script, registered if `window.mcp` exists — lets an
  agent read/drive the live projection. Keep the `execute` handler's
  allow-list (`if (k === 'foo' && ...) state.foo = v`) in sync with any new
  `ids`/boolean/enum state field.

### The `simulate()` / `simulateHistorical()` duplication trap

These two functions share large near-identical blocks of logic (contribution
limits, RMD/RRIF math, tax profile construction, healthcare/LTC costs,
withdrawal waterfall, etc), but are **not** literally identical — each has
its own local variable names in places (e.g. `factor`/`limitFactor` differ
between them) and only one of them has certain features (e.g. only
`simulate()` models the Roth conversion ladder / RRSP meltdown ladder and
ACA/IRMAA gating; `simulateHistorical()` deliberately omits those). When a
new feature needs to touch both:

1. **Never assume a change to one automatically applies to the other** —
   port it deliberately, checking the parallel spot for structural
   differences first (a subagent/`Grep` pass to diff the two functions side
   by side before editing is worth the time on anything nontrivial).
2. The `Edit` tool's exact-string matching will frequently fail with
   "Found 2 matches" because the same code stretch exists verbatim in both
   functions. Either widen the `old_string` with enough unique surrounding
   context to disambiguate, or — for large multi-line blocks — use a
   precise Node.js line-range-replacement script (read the file, split into
   lines, assert the exact first/last line of the target range match an
   expected literal before splicing, write back) so you don't accidentally
   edit the wrong copy.
3. After editing, **syntax-check both files** before running anything else:
   ```bash
   node -e "
   const fs = require('fs');
   const html = fs.readFileSync('Planner_US.html', 'utf8');
   const scripts = [...html.matchAll(/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/g)].map(m => m[1]);
   scripts.forEach((s, i) => { try { new Function(s); } catch (e) { console.log('SYNTAX ERROR', i, e.message); process.exit(1); } });
   console.log('syntax OK');
   "
   ```
   (swap the filename for the Canada planner too). This catches a mismatched
   brace/paren from a bad splice immediately, before you've spent time on
   Playwright debugging a problem that's actually just a parse error.

## US vs. Canada: same shape, different names and one fewer tax branch

The two planners share the same overall structure but are **not** simple
find-and-replace copies of each other — porting a feature from one to the
other requires re-deriving the equivalent, not just renaming variables:

- US: `ssMonthlyA/B` (Social Security) + `filingStatus` (`mfj`/`single`,
  with a `marryLater` transition age) + `rmdDivisor(age)`. Canada:
  `cppMonthlyA/B` + `oasMonthlyA/B` (with `oasClawback()` recovery tax) +
  `rrifMinPct(age)`, and there is no MFJ/single distinction or
  `marryLater` — Canada always taxes spouses as two individual returns.
- `taxFor(profile, gains, traditionalExtra)` has **3 branches** in the US
  file (`mfj` joint return / `singlePerson` / a "two separate filers" branch
  used only for the pre-marriage `marryLater` case) but only **2** in
  Canada (`singlePerson` / two individual `personTaxCA` calls) — don't
  assume the branch count or names carry over.
- Canada has pension income splitting (`pensionSplitEnabled`,
  `solvePensionSplit()`) with no US equivalent; the US has ACA subsidies,
  IRMAA, and Roth-conversion-ladder MAGI gating with no Canada equivalent
  (Canada's closest analog is the RRSP meltdown ladder, which has no
  income-tested healthcare cliff to gate against).
- Both `taxFor()`'s `singlePerson` branch reads **only** the `A`-slot
  profile fields (`otherA`, `wageA`, etc. in the US; just `otherA` in
  Canada) — this is why survivor modeling (one partner dies) has to
  actively remap the surviving partner's data into the `A` slot when it's
  Partner A who died, rather than just setting `profile.singlePerson = true`
  and leaving the data where it was.
- When asked to port a feature between the two files, do the research pass
  first (read both functions' relevant sections side by side) before
  writing any edits — the two files diverge in exactly the ways that make
  blind copy-paste silently wrong (double-counted tax, a feature gate that
  doesn't exist on the other side, a variable name that means something
  slightly different).

## Testing checklist for any change

1. `npm test` (golden math tests — must stay exact-to-the-cent).
2. Syntax-check both `.html` files (see snippet above).
3. Run the specific `test_*.js` file(s) relevant to what changed, plus a
   broad sweep of the rest if the change touches `simulate()`/
   `simulateHistorical()`, `syncControls()`/`syncContributionControls()`,
   or anything in the shared per-year loop (a change there can have
   non-obvious knock-on effects on unrelated features).
4. Mobile-width check for any new sidebar field or result card (390×844
   viewport, assert no horizontal overflow):
   ```js
   document.documentElement.scrollWidth > document.documentElement.clientWidth
   ```
5. If the feature has a UI toggle, verify with Playwright that toggling it
   actually changes `window.fireProjection` / the relevant DOM output —
   don't just check that the checkbox's own `.checked` state is correct;
   confirm the state change actually propagates through to a visible
   result. This is the single most common way a wiring bug slips through in
   this codebase (see the `syncControls()` vs. `syncContributionControls()`
   trap above).

## Commit conventions

- Regular commits, no special attribution needed for local/manual edits.
- When Claude Code makes the commit, it appends its own attribution
  trailer automatically per the harness's standing instructions — don't
  hand-author that trailer yourself in a prompt or template.
- One feature (or tightly related group of changes) per commit; commit
  messages should explain *why*, not just restate the diff.
- **Docs are updated in the same batch of work as the code change, not as
  a separate later pass.** If a change is user-facing, update `README.md`'s
  feature list before/alongside committing (see git history for the
  pattern — e.g. the commit that documented the survivor-planning and
  cash-flow-Sankey features). If a change is architectural — a new shared
  helper, a new US/Canada divergence, a new gotcha worth knowing about —
  update this file (`CLAUDE.md`) the same way. The repo may exist as
  multiple independent local clones with no shared remote between them
  (e.g. a disposable cloud-agent working copy alongside the person's own
  machine), so the two docs, kept current in the repo itself, are what let
  a session with no memory of prior conversations — or a differently-synced
  copy of the repo — pick up accurately from the repo contents alone.
